== Description ==

SMTP2GO’s WordPress plugin replaces the default built in wp_mail() functionality (phpmailer) and sends your email via SMTP2GO’s API and industry leading email delivery platform.

SMTP2GO provides valuable insights into every aspect of your email's life cycle, enabling you to track delivery rates, opens, clicks, and bounce rates. Whether your email is transactional, marketing, newsletter, contact form, or notification - we have got you covered.

**The main benefits of using the official SMTP2GO plugin:**

* Take over from the default WordPress email system for more reliable delivery - you can be confident your emails have arrived at their destination inbox successfully.

== FAQ ==

= Do I need an SMTP2GO account? =

Yes, the SMTP2GO WordPress plugin uses SMTP2GO’s API to deliver emails and get statistics. Creating an account on SMTP2GO quick and simple - [sign up here](https://www.smtp2go.com/).

Once logged into your account and you have completed the required setup steps, you can get an API Key (Sending > API Keys) which you’ll need to get the plugin up and running.

= How much will it cost me? =

SMTP2GO offers a free plan that includes 1,000 emails per month. You can use this for your WordPress site but also any other email and SMTP needs you have! One account can cover all your inbox delivery and SMTP needs.

For more email volume per month and fewer restrictions, you can easily upgrade to one of the many available plans to suit your sending needs. Paid plans start at $10 USD/month - check out our [pricing here](https://www.smtp2go.com/pricing).

= Can you tell me about the compatibility of this plugin? =
Sure can! We replace the default **wp_mail** so most other plugins that need to send email will be compatible.

We are always looking to improve, so if you do find any compatibility issues, please let us know.

**Email Made Easy** has been tested for Linux and other Unix type operating systems. We do not recommend using the plugin on Windows/IIS based systems as we do not currently support these platforms.

We also recommend keeping your WordPress up to date and only use the the most recent version of WordPress, or no more than one major release behind.

= Can I get support? =

Absolutely! The SMTP2GO support team has agents located in the US, EU, UK, and the Pacific to cover all time zones providing assistance when you need it most. If you have questions or need help then feel free to contact the support team by logging into your SMTP2GO dashboard and clicking on the support icon on the top-right. We can be reached by instant message, ticket, or phone.


= How do I avoid emails going to the spam or junk folder? =

1. Check that your domain names are fully verified in the "Sending > Verified Sender" section of your SMTP2GO account.

2. Make sure your domain has a great reputation and isn't listed on any blacklists. A good place to start checking is MXToolbox.

3. Think about your email content and subject line to avoid words and phrases that could trigger a spam filter.

If you're needing extra help, our support team has lots of tips and tricks to help you out. You can find the support tab in your SMTP2GO dashboard.
